After reading, scratching the internet, doing multiple projects to solve the fad behind machine learning, taking couple of courses, I wanted to test how much I undertstood and know about the field in the last one and a half year. So I approached my director at Women Who Code Delhi, Brihi Joshi, with the idea of teaching people machine learning from scratch but from a practical perspective. Brihi was not only supportive but together we proposed an entire series out of it; We called it 'Practically ML'.

Practically ML was one of a kind ML series that taught its attendees theoretical concepts of machine learning from a applicative perspective. The series took place as a workshop of four lectures. 

The series was attended by 300+ high school students, undergraduates, researchers and industry professionals. We pragmatically derived all equations from scratch, and conducted engaging out-of-the-box competitions to ensure collaborative understanding. ​Each session concluded with contests where attendees solved questions like, ‘Designing an algorithm to fetch k most relevant documents using different types of learning algorithms’ or tweaked the classical algorithms like ‘designing K means clustering algorithm if some labels are known’. ​

> It was extremely satisfying to see teams with proportionate men and women standing at the platform, presenting their solutions and posing foundational questions​

Topics covered in the lecture series:

- Session 1:

	- Part1: Introduction to Python for Machine Learning (Introduction to Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib)

	- Part2: Introduction to Machine Learning (Terminologies, types of learning)

- Session 2: Linear Regression (Theory, code from scratch, sklearn implementation)

- Session 3: Logistic Regression (Theory, Code from scratch, Concepts, Sklearn implementation)

- Session 4: Unsupervised Learning - K-Means Clustering (Theory, Code from scratch, Concepts, Sklearn implementation)

The ​series ended with bolstering reviews t​o an extent that the second series, titled 'Practically DL', on practical applications of deep learning is already on its way​.
