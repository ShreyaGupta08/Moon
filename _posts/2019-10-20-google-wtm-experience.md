<!-- WTM experience  -->

I applied for WTM scholarship for the first time on 8th August 2018. It was during the application process that this sudden realisation hit me that I hadn’t done anything for the field that I had been so vocal about since eternity. Immediately after submitting the application I dropped a text to my college senior who I came to know was extensively involved in uplifting women-in-tech. I met her, and started volunteering in events held by Women Who Code Delhi and Women in Machine Learning and Data Science (WiMLDS) Delhi. Eventually I joined them and organised and delivered a talk, mentored a group of 7 students, and conducted a 4 lecture series on Machine Learning from an implementation point of view. This year I applied again.

I was in Los Angeles, on xyz June 2019, when I received an email from them telling me I had made it through the first round. The next and final round consisted of a telephonic interview with a Googler in a couple of days. Scheduling the call was an eventful task because of the time difference but when the interview finally happened, it was a great 30 minute conversation. It was a casual one-on-one conversation wherein the Googler asked me about the organisational work I had been doing. She asked me how I would keep a women-in-tech organisation afloat, how I encourage more women to participate and volunteer in the events, and how do we handle guys who condemn these organisations that promote gender equality in STEM fields. The conversation started with a ‘Tell-me-about-yourself’ and by the end we were discussing how important these organisations are if we are to remove gender disparity and empower women to fight for equal rights in and outside workplaces and how we could not please everybody. My interviewer also asked me about my research project at IIT-Delhi and grasped the specifics very quickly. She asked me how and why Women Techmakers was important for me. I told her it would give me an opportunity to connect with fellow scholars who have been doing exceptional work in this domain and would help me to take my regional organisations on a global scale, improving its outreach and learning from the fellow scholars. It gives me joy to share we are already in process of organising our first cross-country webinar with a scholar from Taiwan, something that has never happened in WTM APAC history, as told to me by my country POC. 

## THE RETREAT
This year the WTM retreat happened in Google Sydney headquarters. I was so excited to be in Sydney. The retreat was scheduled for 29-31 August 2019. I flew from my research internship in LA to India on the 26th and left for Sydney on the 27th. Our stay was in Novotel, Sydney, an amazing hotel. The rooms were great and comfortable and my roommate, who reached just 15 minutes before me, was from South Korea. Her name was Hyunsung. She was extremely nice and welcoming. 

### Day 0
Since we reached on 28th and had our return flights on the morning of 1st September, day 0 was the only day we had for sight seeing. I along with my roommate and her two fellow scholars from South Korea went around Sydney, seeing the most we could in a single day. We walked across the Harbour Bridge, saw the entire town of Sydney from the top of a tower, saw the Opera House, took a ferry to Watsons Bay and walked to the manly beach, one of the prettiest walks I’ve made. We made it in time to join in for the Welcoming Dinner in Google office. We were given some very important survival kit for the Sydney weather: WTM Hoodies and umbrella, and of course pizza. This was our first meeting with the fellow scholars and Google TOPs specialists and Engineers from different regions of APAC.  

### Day 1, Theme: Own Your Career

#### Opening Keynote: Grace Chung (Manager, ChromeOS, Sydney)
I couldn’t imagine the vent being kicked off in a better way than by the talk Grace gave. I’m grateful to her for sharing her unfortunate experiences in the corporate, eventually how the prodigy found place in MIT and in the Natural Language lab of MIT. Her perspective of life and her advice to be self aware of our limiting believes will always stay. Highlight: Her reply to Imposter Syndrome- “It’s okay. Somebody made the mistake of hiring me, so I’m here so I’m gonna say it and do it!’ Love her!

#### Bias Busting by Gordon Rowell (SREM)
Gordon was an experienced professional who had conducted similar workshops before. He taught us how and when to intervene on bias in workplaces. How to use gender neutral and friendly terms like ‘he/she’ in lieu of just ‘he’; Instead of simply saying ‘You are sexist’, appeal to the offender’s values and present to them another view of why it matters to you. He suggested to use ‘I’ statements to express you FELT it.  According to him “It is important to use gender neutral language because gender really doesn’t matter”.

#### Google Women Engineers (GWE)
This was a panel of three amazing GWE who each spoke briefly about their journey to Google and further answered a Q/A session. 
1. Minori Inoue (Tokyo office): Minori was polite, smart and humble, just like most Googlers you would see. She switched from Chemical Engineering to Computer Science during her masters when she did 5 internships DURING her masters (isn’t it incredible?). She does an exciting job of video segmenting to recommend users the part of video that matches with their search. According to her a good engineer is technical, possesses cognitive abilities, good communication and leadership skills.  
2. Ruixi Deng (Beijing office): Ruixi switched from Mechanical Engineering to CS during her CMU days when she found prof. David Kosbie. Her ‘Don’t be afraid to ask Questions!’ Will always resonate with me. 
3. Rachael Gordon (Sydney office): Rachel was a former WTM scholar and had worked in Google Drive, Google maps and finally now in Google Photos. “Look for opportunities and take them”, the importance of soft skills, her snowball effect of making things ‘a little better’ and her stress on the importance of networking is something I wish to keep myself reminded as I progress to new spheres of life. She also stressed on finding good support and cherish it, on ‘climbing stairs you want to climb’ and ‘if you have curiosity, follow it’.

#### #IamRemarkable
Is the name enough? Say it till you believe it, #Iamremarkable was an event of realising self worth and about not being scared of talking about your achievements, something we females are very hesitant of. We wrote 5 of our professional and personal achievements and in small groups talked about the top 1 from each category. It was an unparalleled feeling of saying the things in both categories and hearing other’s achievements. I hope to practice and conduct this activity with my peers! It was incredible beyond words.

### Day 2, Theme: Investing in Yourself

#### Google Interviews
Some key interview tips (especially for Google) starting from preparing CV to the actual interview, where we got to see a demo interview between two Googlers, illustrating the transition from a bad interview to a great one. We then paired up with another scholar and conducted a mock interview and switched between being the interviewer and interviewee.  

##### Interview approach
1. Clarify
2. Think
3. Code
4. Test
5. Improve
All the while, communicating everything that passes your mind.

#### Daniel Nadasi (Google Photos)
Finding a good team:
1. Supporting and empowering manager (who gives you resources and constructive feedback)
2. A Team that you can learn from (That is better than you)
3. The organisation aligns with your culture and purpose (A sense of belongingness) 
He suggested us to learn
- new tech and be prepared
- Your limitations and play with things
He believed the generalisations and curiosity in ML is daunting (I may agree)

for CS students and faculty (insert link)

#### Giving and Receiving Feedback
1. Specific - based on facts and observations, not emotional
2. Honest - don’t sugarcoat but be genuine and watch your tone
3. Actionable - show you care and provide suggestions and solutions

Give timely feedback

- Giving feedback: 
        - Take self value out (Avoid phrases like ‘I am angry’)
        - Remember other person’s value
        - Be empathetic (Ask yourself will this help the other person? How will it help?)
    1. Prepare: Give a heads up (“Hey, I want to talk about xyzzy”)
    2. Describe: Situation (the when and where)-Behaviour (what and how)-Impact approach (when you did X, I felt…)
    3. Discuss (Recommendations, mutual understanding, time for reflection)
    4. Follow through
- Receiving Feedback:
        - Be willing, embrace all of it
        - Thank the other person
        - Decide what you are going to do with it


### Day 3, Theme: For the Community

#### Community Impact Panel
1. Mia Roh (Tensorflow Lite, Korea) suggested we make study groups and gave us a lot of encouragement
2. Bhavya Chandra (Google Singapore) gave us pointers on how to start our own community:
    1. Find target audience
    2. Find community platform
    3. Seeding- ask for help!
    4. Engagement
    5. Moderation
    6. Marketing
    7. Finally, Feedback
3. Nicky Ringland also gave some amazing pointers from her own experience on how to start and sustain a community
    1. What is the problem?
    2. How can you fix it?
    3. Have a plan
        1. Jk. Just start
    4. Get the word out!
    5. Look for your people (Work for your organisation!)
She recommended ‘Unlocking the Club Science’ and it is on my top now

#### TRIP TO THE ZOO!!

## FINAL WORDS
The three days were absolutely amazing. I got to interact with some AMAZING Googlers and scholars, ask them questions about their work and talk about my work. It was not only fostering to know it is okay to not know but also to learn to talk about your achievements with pride instead of hiding them in yourself. 
It has been more than a month to the retreat and every time I see a post from a fellow scholar, it brings about a smile on my face of all the things they are doing! I am so proud of my girls. I have reached out to my fellow scholars for collaborations and so have they. After a long time it feels so great to be surrounded by people who talk about tech and life
