## RIPS Internship - The people

(In progress)

I had the fantastic opportunity to work as a Research Intern at Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) for the summers of 2019. One would expect a place like LA to be remarkable. It was. But what made the internship an unforgettable one was the people. It has been two weeks since the intern ended but I still keep saying phrases (like LET’S GOOO, you hate to see it, subtle flex) I caught from there. 

## Miguel

Miguel was first my teammate, then my office partner and finally my project manager. I can’t begin to testify how amazing he was at all three of his designations. He was my primary interaction for the first few weeks and we spent most of our office time together. Miguel was undoubtedly THE BEST office partner I could ever imagine having. He not only enlightened me with the most amazing wines and videos, but pair programming with him was the most fun. Together we came up with the best acronym for our proposed framework in the project. He is amazingly smart, efficient and caring. He is genuine and honest. He taught me the importance a relationship deserves, how to compartmentalise things, and the power of efficiency. He is a great listener and our conversation on the bus ride to San Francisco will always be a highlight.

## Mohammad Uzair

Where do I begin. Half the time I was confused if to call him Mohammad or Uzair but I never thought twice before randomly texting him to ask if he wanted to buy things for his family, at the randomest of times. Mohammad, my fellow from Pakistan, was a home away from home. We went for shopping together and when one of us was confused (which we inevitably were mostly), the other would take the call; it was effortless. It took me a week to strike up a conversation with him, but I’ll always be thankful to that one fine tea-time. Uzair taught me how to keep my priorities straight and not let the background noise affect me. He knew why was there, what his objectives were, and hence didn’t run after the popular notions. From forcing him to go out to packing together followed by impromptu going to the beach, Mohammad was all my adventures and advice in a person.

## Duda

Duda was my best friend. She was my first friend, thanks to the trip to social security office and for the serendipituous cab sharing. It was the first time I realised I was not the only person feeling different the other side of Mississippi. Duda is honest, funny and crazy fun. She is not only smart but also a compassionate listener and I loved giving advices to this tall girl of perfection. She introduced me to the most fun people (including her team, in the best form)! The best thing about Duda was she knew she was imperfect, but she was so secure with who she was, it was contagious. She surrounded herself with amazing people (including me) and taught me how to ‘not worry about it’, how if ‘you want it, you got it’ and how machine learning is not the only place math can revolutionise. To Duda, let’s stay connected on LinkedIn.

## Roland

Roland was the Program Manager at IPAM. He was not only the sweetest but also the most heart warming person. Because of jetlag, I engaged myself in drinking a lot of coffee and as a result often met him at the coffee machine. We would end up talking about everything, from his chef adventures and catering for the celebrities to my latest shenanigans. He made me cry when he made me a massive Indian-style rice pudding for my 21st birthday. Roland taught me that it doesn't take a lot of effort to make a person happy, just genuine care and appreciation for their small feats. Randomly going up to him to ask about some stationary and leaving 20 minutes later with so much new knowledge and a wide smile is what I probably miss about my work now.

## Susana

The token of appreciation would be incomplete without the person who made it all happen. Susana is the director of RIPS and changed my life in less than 6 weeks. I remember reading on my senior's blog about how she was so great that I was conscious about talking to her initially. I felt pressured when I listened to her talking about my college senior (who was a RIPS scholar last year) with such high regards and him complementing her with tantamount gratitude. I wondered if I could ever bring that spark in her eyes. It was when I went to tell her about my Women Techmakers Scholarship that broke the ice and made me realise I came with a clean slate and didn't have to keep up with the history. Every conversation with her left me amazed. How she was such a loving and caring person while still maintaining her authority is something that leaves me astounded. Such was her grandeur. She made me believe in myself and assured me that I wasn't there by some fluke. From her I learned perspective. I continue sending her regular updates because we promised we would. I could write a book about her and still feel short of words when describing how monumental she's been.

## Dima

Dima is the director of IPAM and inspired me the most in the brief interaction I had with him. He is an extremely dedicated, knowledgeable, and humble person. His genuine devotion towards the field inspired me to read more.
