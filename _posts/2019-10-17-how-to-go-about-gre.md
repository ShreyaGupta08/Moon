Before reading further, familiarise yourself with GRE and its format by watching an introductory video on YouTube. This post will assume familiarity with GRE, its purpose, important, pattern, structure and the variety of questions encountered in the test.

> This post will give a brief about some selective resources one can refer to to prepare for the GRE, some suggestions for each section and what to do during the test day.

## Ideal preparation time: 2-3 months 
(May vary depending upon your retention, grasping of concepts, schedule and urgency)

### Breakdown: 
- First 15-20 days - going hard on the vocabulary 
                            - start practicing quant
- Next 15 days - start practicing reading comprehensions more, lightly practicing text completion. And sentence equivalence. Quant should become a little more extensive

- Next 15 days - aggressive practicing of all the three verbal sub-parts. Do 10 question sets. Strong command on quant. Start looking at the know-hows of AWA

- Final 15-20 days - start giving mock tests, identify your weak points, practice on them 

## Selective Resources (May vary depending on individual experience)

1. Words/Vocab - Magoosh Common and Basic Words of Magoosh App (Minimum requirement)
2. Quant - Magoosh videos (paid) for tips, Manhattan 5lb for practice
3. Verbal - Manhattan videos (paid), Greg mat videos (YouTube) and Kaplan guide to learn, Manhattan 5lb to practice
4. AWA - Kaplan guide (hands down best explanations and suggestions)
5. Additional: ETS Official guides for General, Verbal and Quant
6. Mock Tests: Refer to this list - https://crunchprep.com/gre/2014/free-gre-practice-tests, Princeton was my personal favourite. 

## Areas of Focus

For the quant, focus on accuracy.

For verbal, focus on timed accuracy, learning to cut through the passage in reading comprehension and understand the identifying words in text completion and sentence equivalence.

For AWA, In issue task, identify points for pros-cons/support-against and 1-3 examples for each side before starting; present views from both sides, not only statements that support your side
in argument task, write the first paragraph stating the conclusion and evidences provided by there author first; then find logical jumps/fallacies in each statement, choose which ones to elaborate (generally 2-3) and denote a paragraph to each, finally write a paragraph on what the author could have said but did not say, to support his conclusion.

## Mock Tests:
The best was honestly Princeton practice tests because they were the only ones that provided you 6 sectioned GRE, not only with the actual template of GRE but also with evaluated AWA essays. The feedback on essays are great and insightful. Suggestion: give this test 2-3 days before the actual GRE.

> Two weeks before the actual GRE, start giving mock tests. 
Some do it alternate days, give the test on one day, study the results and feedbacks and strengthen your weak point the buffer day; some do it daily, give the mock test in one half, study in the other. Upto you but try to give 3-5 mock tests. Should be sufficient.

## For the vocabulary:
A GRE Buddy is great for memorising vocal words - to get to learn in a fun way
You can also refer to the app called quizlet that contains all lists and different ways to memorise the words.
Jamboree’s extensive vocabulary list is sometimes useful to know synonyms but you can also Google words to know that.

### Before the test day:
Revise all the vocabulary words
See the states/institution codes of the colleges you would fill up if the score is good.
Read sample grade 6 ETS essays

## Test centre and day suggestions:

If centre == prometric Gurgaon:
	bring a transparent water bottle, some high-energy snack to eat during the 10 min break and passport, no pen/pencil/watch.

### During the test:

- Freshen up before the test.
- If you are an extensive stress water drinker like me, take very small sips during paper so that you don’t have to go the loo in between the paper.

### During the 10 min break:

- Drink water
- Gently exercise your body from head, neck, arms, waist to feet to wake them up 
- Eat a small energy rich food (like snickers) 
- Go to the restroom, freshen up, wash your face 
- Close your eyes take deep breathes/meditate and relax your mind
- Move your arms and feet and enter back up
Tip: Don’t think too much about what has happened, encourage yourself to use all the mind you’ve got for the remaining sections

### During the 6th section:
It is natural to think that this might be the bogus section, partially because you are tired by this time, but don’t. Give your best at each section you do. Do not try to guess the bogus section. It will do you more bad than good. 

Finally, don’t stress out too much. Remember, you can. It’s easier than you think. Trust me.
All the best!
