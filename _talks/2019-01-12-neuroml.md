I am currently in Los Angeles, probably doing the internship I have waited for what seems like forever. The best thing about my internship still remains the diversity and the gender ratio. My team has 3 girls and a guy. This is just numbers and nothing more than that. In practice, for the first time it feels like we are just 4 humans trying to solve (read: struggling through) a problem. 

Last night I had the priviledge of watching Hidden Figures by Theodore Melfi. The timing and the theme of the movie could not be more in sync with my beliefs and ideologies. At the time when Apollo 11 Moon Mission completes its 50 years, Hidden Figures is about 3 African-American (women of color) who were the brains behind one of the greatest operations in history: the launch of astronaut John Glenn (Glen Powell) into orbit [1]. The women, firsts in most things they did, turned the Space Race and galvanized the world at a time when women, let alone women of color, were not seen stalwart and capable of handling things of prime importance. Battling with race, sexism, and being the only women in multiple rooms, these women did not lose their confidence. When times were low, they supported each other, when their bosses referred to them as 'gentlemen', they worked towards establishing their identities and did not deter from standing up for themselves when boundaries were crossed or credit was due.

These women, including JoAnn Morgan and Margaret Hamilton, teach me the importance of dedicated hardwork, the importance of community, self-belief, and the need to raise your voice in lieu of playing the victim card. They tell you that we are above the color of our skin and the gender on our card; that we are the knowledge that we have and the things we read. I hope I can be someone's Margaret someday and do work that contributes to the world like their did. 

Big shoutout to Hidden Figures for reinstating that 'we are here not because of our skirts but because of our glasses'.
