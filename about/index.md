## Brief 
I am a 3rd-year undergraduate at Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India, interested in Machine Learning-oriented research. Having used ML in the fields of healthcare, surveillance and software engineering, I'm deeply fascinated by the power and utility it possesses. I aim to bring a change in this world with the help of theoretical and applied Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. 

Research in Industrial Projects for Students (RIPS) scholar and incoming Research Intern at Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics, UCLA.
