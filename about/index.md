<center>I am a dissident of the conventional approaches to machine learning and aim to understand the world behind the three lines of code.</center>


## Brief 
I am a senior-year Computer Science and Software Engineering undergraduate at Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India, interested in Machine Learning-oriented research. Having used ML in the fields of healthcare, surveillance and software engineering, I'm deeply fascinated by the power and utility it possesses. I aim to bring a change in this world with the help of theoretical and applied Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing with a strong inclination towards researching the mathematics behind them. 

Welcome to my space!
