## Brief 
I am a 3rd-year undergraduate at Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India, interested in Machine Learning-oriented research. Having used ML in the fields of healthcare, surveillance and software engineering, I'm deeply fascinated by the power and utility it possesses. I aim to bring a change in this world with the help of theoretical and applied Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. 

Welcome to my space!
